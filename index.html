    As an experienced Code for Sustainable Homes and BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment consultant, I have advised design teams on how to meet tough environmental standards in challenging circumstances.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to the consultancy work in environmental certification, I also prepared Planning Sustainability Statements and advise on accessibility, Environmental Management and Construction Management Plans for Listed Buildings and bespoke
    developments.
    <br>
    <br>
    As part of my role as Head of Governance when working at Hodkinson Consultancy I documented, implemented and maintained the Quality and Health and Safety Management Systems, as well as overseeing the implementation of the Environmental Management
    System of the company.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the time of my departure I was working towards gaining the OHSAS 18001:2007 and renewing our Safemark Accreditation.
